#  Hi, I'm Benita Roy

I'm a final-year B.Tech student in **Information Technology**, focused on building **real-time voice systems** and solving problems in **applied machine learning** and **algorithmic graph theory**. I care about technical clarity, low-latency interaction, and building things from scratch when it matters.

##  What I'm Currently Working On

-  **Full Stack Web Development** – User creation authentication, Post and Comment CRUD ops    
-  **Speech Systems** – Wake word detection, speech-to-text, intent recognition, and emotion-aware voice interfaces  
-  **Graph Complexity** – Fine-grained studies on variants of NP-hard problems (e.g. dominating sets in bisplit graphs)

##  Tech Stack

**Languages**: Python, C, Java, JavaScript  
**ML & Audio**: PyTorch, torchaudio, librosa, NumPy, SciPy, sounddevice  
**Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
**Version Control**: Git  
**Database**: MySQL  
**Core Subjects**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, DBMS, Computer Organisation, Theory of Computation

##  Projects

###  Personal Voice Assistant 
> Wake-word activated, real-time assistant.  
> Built from scratch with a custom STT pipeline and intent handling system. (IN PROGRESS)
> Emphasis: **low latency**, **on-device inference**, and **no pre-glued models**.

###  Heart Sound Jacket (SCTIMST)  
> Flutter UI for simulating 10+ cardiac conditions via Arduino hardware.  
> Validated with clinical practitioners, focused on clarity and responsiveness.

###  Emotion Detection from Speech  
> Transcribed audio using Whisper, classified emotion using DistilBERT.  
> Achieved **85%+ accuracy** across 6 classes.  
> Built to test how models respond to **real, noisy input** — not just ideal samples.
