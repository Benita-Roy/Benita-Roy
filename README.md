# 👋 Hi, I'm Benita Roy

I'm a final-year B.Tech student in **Information Technology**, focused on building **real-time voice systems** and solving problems in **applied machine learning** and **algorithmic graph theory**. I care about technical clarity, low-latency interaction, and building things from scratch when it matters.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

- 🎙 **Speech Systems** – Wake word detection, speech-to-text, intent recognition, and emotion-aware voice interfaces  
- 🧮 **Graph Complexity** – Fine-grained studies on variants of NP-hard problems (e.g. dominating sets in bisplit graphs)  
- 💻 **End-to-End Systems** – Full pipelines from raw data/audio → model → command execution or UI feedback

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Languages**: Python, C, Java, JavaScript  
**Core**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Database Management System, Computer Organisation, Theory of Computation
**ML & Audio**: PyTorch, torchaudio, librosa, NumPy, SciPy, sounddevice
**Frontend**: HTML, CSS
**Version Control**:Git
**Database**: MySQL

## 🛠️ Projects

### 🔊 Personal Voice Assistant (WIP)
> Wake-word activated, real-time assistant.  
> Built from scratch with a custom STT pipeline and intent handling system.  
> Emphasis: **low latency**, **on-device inference**, and **no pre-glued models**.

### 🗣 Emotion Detection from Speech  
> Transcribed audio using Whisper, classified emotion using DistilBERT.  
> Achieved **85%+ accuracy** across 6 classes.  
> Built to test how models respond to **real, noisy input** — not just ideal samples.

### 🫀 Heart Sound Jacket (SCTIMST)  
> Flutter UI for simulating 10+ cardiac conditions via Arduino hardware.  
> Validated with clinical practitioners, focused on clarity and responsiveness.
